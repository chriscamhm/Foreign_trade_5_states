# Foreign_trade_5_states
<h1><center> General objective </center></h1>

The present code has as aim to represent the evolution of the international trade of **Michigan** and its neighbour states **Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana** by an animated and interactive graphic. The data used are exports, imports and balance trade extracted by scrapping web tecnhniques from the USA Census Bureau. 
The data is monthly and posted online by the Census bureau in the same frequency. Hence, there were multiple files corresponding to monthly data for **exports by origin of movement** and **imports by state destination** both of them not seasonally adjusted. So, in order to learn and avoiding to download many files and joining them I applied scrapping web techniques that I learned from different sources and it was a magnific technique to learn in order to download public databases. 
The links are the following:

**Exports:** https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/origin_movement/index.html

**Imports:** https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/destination_state/index.html
